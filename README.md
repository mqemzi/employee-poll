# Employee Polls Web App

Employee Polls is a web app build in React as part of  Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree course.

## Project Overview

You have been asked by the HR department of your company to build an application that employees can use internally. In order to improve collaboration and transparency within the company, every employee can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. In addition, HR has requested you have a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered. To give employees incentive to use your application, HR will give a prize each quarter for the top employees who have created and answered the most polls.

An employee can create polls for coworkers. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.

Users will be able to answer polls, see which polls they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post polls, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

The _DATA.js file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the_DATA.js file is the value of avatarURL. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

- Users
- Questions

### Users

Users include:

| Attribute    | Type             | Description           |

| questions | Array | A list of ids of the polling questions this user created|
| answers      | Object         |  The object's keys are the ids of each question this user answered. The value of each key is the answer the user selected. It can be either `'optionOne'` or `'optionTwo'` since each question has two options.

Voting options are attached to questions. They include:

- `_saveQuestion(question)`
- `_saveQuestionAnswer(object)`

1) `_getUsers()` Method

*Description*: Get all of the existing users from the database.  
*Return Value*: Object where the key is the user’s id and the value is the user object.

2) `_getQuestions()` Method

*Return Value*: Object where the key is the question’s id and the value is the question object.

3) `_saveQuestion(question)` Method
